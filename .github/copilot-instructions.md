# AI Guardians - Workshop Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a full-day workshop project focused on AI development. The codebase is in its initial setup phase.

## Project Structure
Currently minimal structure:
- `README.md` - Project introduction
- `.env` - Environment configuration (empty, add secrets here)

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
When setting up this project:
- Check `.env` for required environment variables
- Refer to README.md for workshop context and goals

### Code Organization
As the project develops, follow these conventions:
- Keep workshop exercises organized by module or topic
- Document each exercise's learning objectives inline
- Use clear, educational variable and function names for workshop participants

## Environment & Configuration
- Store sensitive data (API keys, tokens) in `.env`
- Never commit `.env` to version control (already gitignored)
- Document required environment variables in README when added

## Workshop Context
This is a learning environment where:
- Code should prioritize clarity over optimization
- Include comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Structure examples to demonstrate best practices progressively
- Consider participants may be at different skill levels

## Future Instructions
As the project develops, update this file with:
- Technology stack decisions (language, frameworks, tools)
- Architectural patterns specific to AI applications
- Testing approaches for AI/ML components
- Data handling and model management conventions
- Integration patterns with AI services/APIs
- Build and deployment procedures

*This instruction file should evolve with the workshop content. Update it as patterns emerge.*
